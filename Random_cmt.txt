                <h3>Xiaomi Redmi K20 Pro</h3>
                <p>With an overall DXOMARK Camera score of 102,
                    the Xiaomi Redmi K20 Pro does not make it into the top ten of DXOMARK Smartphone ranking,
                    but achieves a respectable score for a device in its price bracket.
                    The Photo score of 108 is based on a solid performance across all test categories,
                    without any glaring weaknesses. In general, the camera is capable of producing images with
                    good exposure and a good texture/noise balance in most situations. However, limited dynamic range
                    and visible color casts in some conditions slightly negate the overall positive picture.</p>
